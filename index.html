                <p>What's up yo? My name is Nicky. That's pretty much all there is to say about me.</p>
                <p>jk, I have interests and do things, ya know, being a human being and all. Three things that I do: play tennis, eat noodles, drink beer.
                    Three things I do not do: play cricket, eat shark fin soup, wear nice clothes.
                </p>
                <p>Paragraph #3-- this ones gonna be a doozy. I moved to LA quite recently and it's been just wonderful so far. The foliage out here
                    is quite different from out east. It's nice how there are palm trees and fruit trees, etc. here, but I do miss the lush greenery
                    during the summer on the east coast-- forests overflowing with tangles of bushes and branches and leaves and weeds (ya know, classic
                    plant life stuff #plantlife #stuff). I think that'll do it for now. After all, I'm here to learn to code, not to compose shittily-written
                    paragraphs about plants and such. Nothing against plants by the way; plants are chill.
                </p>
                <p> Let's pretend that I kept writing down here so we can see if the spacing works. Wouldn't it be wonderful if it did?
                    Oh look! It worked. Wonderful.
