    <!-- Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality! -->
    <p>What's up yo? My name is Nicky and I'm from New Jersey. That's pretty much all there is to say about me.</p>
    <p>jk, I have interests and do things, ya know, being a human being and all. Three things that I do: play tennis, eat noodles, drink beer.
        Three things I do not do: play cricket, eat shark fin soup, wear nice clothes.
    </p>
    <p>Paragraph #3-- this ones gonna be a doozy. I moved to LA quite recently and it's been just wonderful so far. The foliage out here
        is quite different from out east. It's nice how there are palm trees and fruit trees, etc. here, but I do miss the lush greenery
        during the summer on the east coast-- forests overflowing with tangles of bushes and branches and leaves and weeds (ya know, classic
        plant life stuff #plantlife #stuff). I think that'll do it for now. After all, I'm here to learn to code, not to compose shittily-written
        paragraphs about plants and such. Nothing against plants by the way; plants are chill.
