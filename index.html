            <p>What's up yo? My name is in the top left of the screen, of course. I guess that's pretty much all there is to say. 
                jk, I have interests and do things, ya know, being a human being and all. Three things that I do: play tennis, eat noodles, 
                drink beer. Three things I do not do: play cricket, eat shark fin soup, wear nice clothes.
            </p>
            <p>I moved to LA quite recently and it's been just wonderful so far. The foliage out here
                is quite different from out east. It's nice how there are palm trees and fruit trees, etc. here, but I do miss the lush greenery
                during the summer on the east coast-- forests overflowing with tangles of bushes and branches and leaves and weeds (ya know, classic
                plant life stuff #plantlife #stuff). I think that'll do it for now. After all, I'm here to learn to code, not to compose shittily-written
                paragraphs about plants and such. Nothing against plants by the way; plants are chill. Especially snap dragon flowers.
            </p>
            <p>What else is going on these days? I've been eating tons of oranges, which has been nothing short of spectacular. My sister
                just graduated from college and she's off to the west coast as well come August. Hm, back to food. I've been cooking a lot 
                of egg whites recently. I think that's kind of the point where things turned around for me in terms of understanding what 
                was good for my health-- as in the point where I just started eating tons of egg whites and not ordering two two-topping medium
                pizzas from Papa Jawn's. That was a rough point. Hindsight really is 20/20.
